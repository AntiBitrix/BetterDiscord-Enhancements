# Discord Typing Indicator Plugin

This is a plugin for BetterDiscord that adds a typing indicator to the text input field in Discord. It creates a border on the right side of the input field that appears to be typing, similar to the typing style in Linux terminal. The plugin adds a 10px solid border on the right side of the input field with a transparent color to give the impression of typing.
